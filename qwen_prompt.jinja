# Context

- **Legal Moves:** (space-separated UCI moves)
{{legal_moves_uci}}

## FEN Explanation
FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) encodes a chess board position using single letters [PNBRKQ] for White pieces and [pnbrkq] for Black pieces. Each rank (row), starting from the top (a8..h8), is specified. All eight squares in a rank are described, with digits [1..8] indicating consecutive empty squares.
- `/8/` denotes a completely empty rank.
- `/4P3/` means four empty squares, then a white pawn, then three more empty squares.

# Task
Select the best move from the provided legal moves list. If no legal moves exist, determine if it's checkmate or stalemate.

1. `<rationale>...</rationale>` - A single concise sentence explaining your move choice
2. `<uci_move>xxxx</uci_move>` - The selected valid move in UCI format

If no legal moves exist, output only: use 0000 for null moves
`<rationale>no legal moves available</rationale><uci_move>0000</uci_move>`
